# zanesville-oh-housing-data

## Problem Statement

In an effort to learn about the effects of three abandoned factories on the house prices in
Zanesville OH, the regional economics class at Ohio University will need to perform a hedonic
analysis, where the hedonic analysis will rely on using the house prices for surrounding homes as a
proxy to get the economic effect. Therefore, in order to perform this analysis, data around the
proximity to the warehouses, appraised values of the homes, and features of the homes need to be
scraped from the Muskingum County auditor's website.

## Requirements

You will need to download [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org) and put the executable (phantomjs) in
the resources folder (create one in local copy if necessary).
